Anxiety, and aggression are common strains experienced by men when failing to conform to rigid masculinity norms @o2008summarizing. The precarious manhood thesis attributes this strain partially to the tenuous and elusive nature of manhood @vandello2008precarious@vandello2013hard. . A novel identity-based model of masculinity aims to explain the adverse effects associated with the precariousness of manhood @stanaland2023masculinity. This model suggests that when a man’s masculinity status is threatened, his compensatory response is influenced by differences in experienced self-discrepancy. The current thesis aims to operationalize and test this model within a German cultural context. Masculinity threat is induced through negative intra-group feedback on gender knowledge. Internalized and externalized threat responses are measured using a word fragment completion task. To assess different discrepancies in the masculine self, participants report both internal and external pressures to conform to masculinity norms. In line with #cite(<stanaland2023masculinity>, form: "prose"), it is hypothesized that external pressure to be masculine predicts externalized threat responses (aggression), while internal pressure predicts internalized threat responses (anxiousness).
