= Discussion
The current studies aim was to replicate masculinity threat effects and their motivational moderators in a German cultural sample.
Based on the proprtion of aggressively and anxiously completed items in the WFCT, the results of this study did not reveal the hypothesized increase of aggressively and anxiously coded items in the threat condition. 
Furthermore, this effect of the threat motivation was not moderated by the pressured and autonomous motivation to be masculine for aggressive and anxious trials repsectively.
Nonetheless, also the failure to replicate these effects highlights prolific insights into the assessment of masculinity threatetenign effects and the motivation for gendered behaviour, that will be beneficial to future work.

== Motivation for Masculine Behaviour in a German Sample
A key objective of the current study was to establish a translation of the MMB in a German cultiral sample and test whether it reveals the same two-factorial structure distinguishing autonomous and pressured motivation to be masculine.
=== Factorial Structure of the MMB Scale
- The CFA showed a sufficiently good fit for a two-factor model on the scale with a few constraints:
- Firstly #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") original model showed the two factors to be uncorrelated. The current study did not show this, as a modeling the factors as uncorrelated produced a bad model fit. From a theoretical perspective, it makes sense to consider these two factors as correlated, since: 1. The underlying constructs are actually related (which is plausible, considering that my own ideals and the expectations of others influence each other). 2. It may be hard for participants to distinguish between their internal and external motivations in these 'simple' one-line sentence. Additionally, the original studies by #cite(<good2010doing>, form: "prose") that investiagted the distinction between external and internal pressured motivation to conform to a gender stereotype, also reported a moderate correlation between their two factors ($r = ...$ ).
- Secondly, one item of the autonomous motivation scale ("Es ist mir wichtig, mich nicht weiblich zu verhalten", original: [It is important to me not to be feminine]) was excluded from the scale, because it showed equally high loadings (.39) on the pressured and autonomous factor. Interestingly, a very similar pattern emerged in the original validation of the scale #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 2;"), where the item loaded only marginally higher on autonomous than pressured motivation (pressured: .36, autonomous: .43). The fact that this pattern seems to emerge consistently is interesting and may stem from an inhernt property of the item: It may be, that the rejection of femininity may inherently be somethig that is associated with an external pressure, rather than an intrinsic motivation. In the current study, we chose to exclude the item, because it showed a poor fit into the hypothesized structure and removing is significantly improved the model fit.
- Thirdly, a resdiual covariate was allowed for items seven and eight of the autonomous motivation factor. This was justified, beacuse both items express positive affect toward masculine identity ("enjoy," "happy") and allowing for the correlation significantly improved the model fit.
In summary ...

=== Sample considerations/translation
Although participants largely come from an academic background, this did not yield very low MMB agreements (previous consideration that a largely universitarian sample may be biased).
\
\
A lot of people in the sample however reported suspicion and were able to identify the true purpose of the study (i.e. experimental manipulation of feedback). This provides a significant challenge when conducting this paradigm in an academic sample, since the participants are more sceptical/ more used to experimental manipulations.

=== Scale construction
- Different methods in assessing the MMB scale: #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 1;") let participants describe their idea of an ideal men and then asked participants with regard to the ideal they described (e.g. In general, I present myself like the man I described because I want others’ acceptance and approval.). In contrast #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 2;") that was aloso the base for this study, omitted the description of an ideal men and asked more generally "In general, I'm masculine because I want others' acceptance and approval.". Notably in their first study, #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") observed a much smaller correlation between the two facors ($r = .15$) than in the second study $r = .5$. 
As this study again produced a high correlation between the two factors, one may assume, that fourmulating of an ideal man helps participants distinguish better autnomous and pressured components of their masculinity. 
\
\
Difficulties translating the scale (männlich sein, vs. männlich verhalten) discussed in the Appendix ...\
-> current results show that the items were comprehensible and none of the items produces severe bottom or ceiling effects.\
-> No factor emerged in the FA that would suggest a facor for phrasing acting vs. state

=== Conclusion on the MMB in a German sample
- Successful translation of the scale and showed a valid and reliable measure for pressured and autonomous motivation for masculine behaviour that replicated previous studies @stanaland2021man@stanaland2023masculinity. 
Future studies that want to investigate pressured and autonomous motivation for masculine behaviour may regard the "state vs. agenticness" of translating traits related to gender (being vs. doing gender), as well as consider the benefit of an introductory text.

== Masculinity Threat Effects
- The study failed to show mascuinity threat effects: Both the hypothesized higher  aggressive and anxious word completions (Hypothesis 1a & 1b), as well as the moderation of this effect via automous and pressured motivation (Hypothesis 2a & 2b) remained non-significant. 
- Three possible reasons for the current sample not showing masculinity threat effects: 1. Failure in operationalization of the threat (i.e. participants did not perceive the stimuli as a threat).  2. There is an issue with the WFCT as a dependent measure for aggressive an anxious cognition. 3. German participants truly do not react with aggressive or anxious responses to a threat to their masculinity (this would challenge the theoretical framework in a German context).
\
\ 
- The first reason for this could be that the study failed to  successfullty induct a masculinity threat to the participants.  
- However, with regard to this, the study contained two checks of experimental maniplation:
- Fistly, participants were asked to recall the feedback that they got from the GKT. Participants in the threat condition reported that their gender knowledge was rated much more feminine feedback than participants in the no threat condition. This shows that participants paid attention to the feedback, as well as the feedback was comprehensible. 
- Secondly, participants were asked to evaluate their own Gender Knowledge from typically feminine to typically masculne. Participants in the threat condition reported a significantly less masculine masculine gender knowledge, than people in the threat condition. This shows that the feedback the participants reveived was also credible.
- Summing up, these results indicate, that the operationalization of masculinity threat was successful.
\
\
- The second reason for failing to measure a masculinity threat response, could be an issue with the WFCT as a dependent measure for aggresive and anxious cognition.
- The current study used this measure, as previous studies were able to successfully use this measure in an English version
- In favor of this argument is a lack of construct validity, assessed via internal consitency of the aggressive and anxious word completion scales: Both scales showed practically no internal consistency of the items, meaning the items of the scales covaried randomly. 
\
\
- The last possibility, could be that the study did not show a masculinity threat efffects, could be that the participants really di not experience aggressive or anxious emotion after a threatening feedback to their mascuinity.
- This is a serious point to discuss, as it would have a serious implication on the theoretical background (precarious manhood, fragile masculinity).
- Also it has to be regarded that the studied population was largely academic and it may have to be considered that this population may not reflect the German society at large.
- Arguments speak against this hypothesis: Firstly, the population does demonstrate some kind of masculinity threat effect with regard to their self-evaluation of Gender Knowledge. But this masculinity threat effect does not reflect aggressive or anxious cognition!!!
- TODO


== Measuring (Masculinity) Threat Response (or something like that)
- As previously highlighted, the lack of validity of the WFCT is likely to have caused the non-observation of masculinity threat effects.
Discuss the benefits, as well as disadvantages of dependent measures for aggressive and anxious cogniotion
1. WFCT
- Advantages: Implicit, which is particularly relevant with a dependent measure that is subject to social desirability (anxious response is incongruent to a masculine stereotype and thus may be underreported). Also participants may not be self-aware to their emotions and thus not be able to report them.
- Disadvantages: Very high measurement error -> there are so many reasons why a subject may complete a word fragment in one way or another -> it would need a lot of items and participants to counter that. An unpublished study by (TODO) tried to cross-validate a word fragment completion task with established measures of aggressive responses, but failed to do so.
2. Self-reporting:
- Advantage: High validity
- Disadvantage: Subject to sicial desirability & lack of self-awareness
3. More implicit measures
- e.g. assessing aggressive cognition via agreement to discriminatory statements (e.g. TODO). 
- Advantage: Good validity, has been successfully used in many studies (TODO).
- Disadvantage: More difficult in studentic/academic samples (as the agreement to discriminatory statements may be generally very low (TODO)).
4. Behvioral measures
- e.g. aggressive behaviour (TODO), stress levels (TODO) ...
Advantages: High validity, less subject to social desirability or self-awareness problems.
Disadvantages: High cost for setup.
\
\
Summary: Future studies for masculinity threat effects \
Should:
- Implement measures to verify operationalization of masculinity threats (e.g. like in the current study)
- Include suspicion checks (like open text responses)
- Use validated measures for measuring threat response
- pay attention to social desirability and self-awareness problems
- pay attention to the interference between their dependent measures and population being studies (e.g. agreement to statements)
Could:
- Use distractor items, to hide the purpose of the study
- Use open text fields to ask about the purpose of the study
- use implicit measures, like the agreement to discriminatory statements

== Theory Discussion

Discuss different theoretical approaches to why masculinity threat responses:
1. The EDT Model
- the current study did not provide evidence in favor of the EDT Model, since it did not show a moderation of masculinity threat effects by aggressive and anxious MMB.
- yet this is likely to a failed measurement of aggressive and anxious behaviour, as the study failed to reproduce simple masculinity threat responses. 
- Conslusion: It remains challenging to empirically test the proposition of the EDT Model. First research is pointing into that direction (cite studies, stanaland etc.) but more research is needed. Especially in the domain of autonomous motivation leading to increased anxious responses, no evidence was yet found for that. Thus Stanaland & Gaither (2021) even hypothesized that "Therefore, manhood may not be precarious in it's entirety but only fragile", and only an externalized pathway for the moderation of masculinity threat effects exists. Yet Vandello et al (2004), Study 4, (and others ??? look again into literature) found an increase of anxious cognition due to masculinity threat and further research is needed to explain the underlying mechanisms for this response.
\
\
Another account for the affective response after a masculinity threat could be the control beliefs. This account has not beed discussed in the literature so far, but it could provide important insights.
- Briefly explain control beliefs and why they  may have an impact on the response to a masculinity threat.
... future studies should take this into account and may swith to a motivational x control belief model of masculinity threats.
\
\
Outside of the context of identifying and studying mechanisms that underly masculinity threat responses, recent studies highlight a challenge to the idea of precarious manhood altogether: By studying female participants responses to a subjective femini threat (negative evaluation of physical femininity), #cite(<wittlin2024us>, form: "prose") female participants showed an increase in anxiety and reduced self-esteem. This challenges the original precarious manhood thesis, since it explained that manhood was something that must be earned, while womanhood is viewed as something inherently given. This naturalistic (is this the right word ???) view of manhood and womanhood has received criticism ever since @chrisler2013womanhood@addis2013theory.
It may be beneficial, not just methdologically, but for egalitarianism in scientific research to decouple our traditional understandings in the binarity of gender and perceive masculinity and feminity on a more broad view (... something like that)
