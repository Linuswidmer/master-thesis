= Discussion
The current studies aim was to replicate masculinity threat effects and their motivational moderators in a German cultural sample.
Based on the proprtion of aggressively and anxiously completed items in the WFCT, the results of this study did not reveal the hypothesized increase of aggressively and anxiously coded items in the threat condition. 
Furthermore, this effect of the threat motivation was not moderated by the pressured and autonomous motivation to be masculine for aggressive and anxious trials repsectively.
Nonetheless, also the failure to replicate these effects highlights prolific insights into the assessment of masculinity threatetenign effects and the motivation for gendered behaviour, that will be beneficial to future work.

== Motivation for Masculine Behaviour in a German Sample
A key objective of the current study was to establish a translation of the MMB in a German cultiral sample and test whether it reveals the same two-factorial structure distinguishing autonomous and pressured motivation to be masculine.
=== Factorial Structure of the MMB Scale
- The CFA showed a sufficiently good fit for a two-factor model on the scale with a few constraints:
- Firstly #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") original model showed the two factors to be uncorrelated. The current study did not show this, as a modeling the factors as uncorrelated produced a bad model fit. From a theoretical perspective, it makes sense to consider these two factors as correlated, since: 1. The underlying constructs are actually related (which is plausible, considering that my own ideals and the expectations of others influence each other). 2. It may be hard for participants to distinguish between their internal and external motivations in these 'simple' one-line sentence. Additionally, the original studies by #cite(<good2010doing>, form: "prose") that investiagted the distinction between external and internal pressured motivation to conform to a gender stereotype, also reported a moderate correlation between their two factors ($r = ...$ ).
- Secondly, one item of the autonomous motivation scale ("Es ist mir wichtig, mich nicht weiblich zu verhalten", original: [It is important to me not to be feminine]) was excluded from the scale, because it showed equally high loadings (.39) on the pressured and autonomous factor. Interestingly, a very similar pattern emerged in the original validation of the scale #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 2;"), where the item loaded only marginally higher on autonomous than pressured motivation (pressured: .36, autonomous: .43). The fact that this pattern seems to emerge consistently is interesting and may stem from an inhernt property of the item: It may be, that the rejection of femininity may inherently be somethig that is associated with an external pressure, rather than an intrinsic motivation. In the current study, we chose to exclude the item, because it showed a poor fit into the hypothesized structure and removing is significantly improved the model fit.
- Thirdly, a resdiual covariate was allowed for items seven and eight of the autonomous motivation factor. This was justified, beacuse both items express positive affect toward masculine identity ("enjoy," "happy") and allowing for the correlation significantly improved the model fit.
In summary ...

=== Sample considerations/translation
Although participants largely come from an academic background, this did not yield very low MMB agreements (previous consideration that a largely universitarian sample may be biased).
\
\
A lot of people in the sample however reported suspicion and were able to identify the true purpose of the study (i.e. experimental manipulation of feedback). This provides a significant challenge when conducting this paradigm in an academic sample, since the participants are more sceptical/ more used to experimental manipulations.

=== Scale construction
- Different methods in assessing the MMB scale: #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 1;") let participants describe their idea of an ideal men and then asked participants with regard to the ideal they described (e.g. In general, I present myself like the man I described because I want others’ acceptance and approval.). In contrast #citeWithPrefix(keys: <stanaland2023masculinity>, prefix: "Study 2;") that was aloso the base for this study, omitted the description of an ideal men and asked more generally "In general, I'm masculine because I want others' acceptance and approval.". Notably in their first study, #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") observed a much smaller correlation between the two facors ($r = .15$) than in the second study $r = .5$. 
As this study again produced a high correlation between the two factors, one may assume, that fourmulating of an ideal man helps participants distinguish better autnomous and pressured components of their masculinity.

Difficulties translating the scale (männlich sein, vs. männlich verhalten) discussed in the Appendix ...\
-> current results show that the items were comprehensible and none of the items produces severe bottom or ceiling effects.\
-> No factor emerged in the FA that would suggest a facor for phrasing acting vs. state

=== Conclusion on the MMB in a German sample
- Successful translation of the scale and showed a valid and reliable measure for pressured and autonomous motivation for masculine behaviour that replicated previous studies @stanaland2021man@stanaland2023masculinity. 
Future studies that want to investigate pressured and autonomous motivation for masculine behaviour may regard the "state vs. agenticness" of translating traits related to gender (being vs. doing gender), as well as consider the benefit of an introductory text.

== Operationalization of masculinity effects
- The study failed to show mascuinity threat effects with aggressive and anxiously completed word fragments as a dependent variable
- Nevertheless, the study contained two checks of experimental maniplation:
- Fistly, participants were asked to recall the feedback that they got from the GKT. Participants in the threat condition reported that their gender knowledge was rated much more feminine feedback than participants in the no threat condition. This shows that participants paid attention to the feedback, as well as the feedback was comprehensible. Secondly, participants were asked to evaluate their own Gender Knowledge from typically feminine to typically masculne. Participants in the threat condition reported a significantly less masculine masculine gender knowledge, than people in the threat condition. This shows that the feedback the participants reveived was also credible.
- Summing up, these results indicate, that the operationalization of masculinity threat was successful and demonstrates as a good method for alternating the experimental condition.
