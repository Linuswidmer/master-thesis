= Discussion

The present study aimed to replicate masculinity threat effects and examine their motivational moderators in a German sample. Contrary to the hypotheses, the results did not reveal the predicted increases in aggressive or anxious cognition following a masculinity threat, nor were these relationships moderated by pressured or autonomous motivation. While these results contrast with previous findings in North American contexts, the following section examines various factors that may have contributed to the absence of the predicted masculinity threat responses.

== Analysis of the Absence of Masculinity Threat Responses

=== Experimental Manipulation

Despite the null results, the experimental manipulation itself appeared successful. Manipulation checks confirmed that participants in the threat condition attended to the feedback and perceived it as credible, reporting a significant decrease in their self-evaluated masculinity compared to the control group. This suggests that the study successfully induced a cognitive appraisal of threat. 

=== Sample Considerations

The study’s ability to detect the consequences of this threat was constrained by the final sample size ($N = 196$), which fell short of the goal of $229$ participants. Furthermore, significant sample attrition (approximately 22%) occurred following attention checks, suspicion, withdrawal of consent, and eligibility criteria. These factors may be attributable to the high academic composition of the sample, as research-savvy populations are often more prone to suspicion, and online questionnaire formats frequently result in lower levels of participant attention.
Nevertheless, post-hoc power analysis indicated that the study still maintained sufficient power ($1 - beta = .96$) to detect the hypothesized medium-sized masculinity threat effects. Only for the moderation effect, which was assumed to be small, did an insufficient level of test power remain ($1 - \beta = .56$).

=== Issues with Dependent Measures

The most plausible explanation for the absence of significant effects concerns the poor measurement quality of the WFCT. While the manipulation successfully induced a threat, the instrument used to capture the resulting cognitive state proved unreliable, as evidenced by extremely poor internal consistency ($alpha$ as low as $.09$) and inadequate sampling adequacy (KMO $< .30$).

This lack of reliability likely stems from the inherent difficulty of designing a WFCT that isolates specific cognitive activation from "lexical noise." In any language, a participant’s completion of a fragment is influenced by a multitude of factors unrelated to the experimental threat, such as individual vocabulary size, word frequency, and "orthographic neighborhood density"—the number of alternative words that can be formed from a single fragment.

While it is theoretically possible to construct a valid WFCT in German, doing so requires balancing these complex lexical variables to ensure that the target word is neither too obvious nor too obscure. In the present study, the high level of measurement error suggests that these uncontrolled factors may have overwhelmed the subtle signal of threat-induced cognitive activation. This mirrors the findings of #cite(<kugler2022>, form: "prose"), who demonstrated that while German WFCT can track stable trait aggression, they struggle to capture the acute, state-level shifts in cognition required for experimental research.

== Measuring Masculinity Threat Response

The psychometric failure of the WFCT highlights a broader challenge in masculinity research: the difficulty of selecting a measure that effectively balances social desirability bias, construct validity, and the ability to differentiate between distinct threat responses.
This necessitates a careful weighing of alternative formats that might better optimize the trade-off between sensitivity and reliability in future studies.

=== Self-Report & Attitdudinal Measures

Explicit self-report measures of emotional states offer high face validity and are well-established in psychological research as a primary method for capturing subjective experience (e.g., @robinson2002belief). Several studies have successfully assessed masculinity threat responses through self-reported emotions such as anger, shame, pride, and public discomfort @valved2021gender @vescio2025masculinity. The primary limitation of this approach is its susceptibility to social desirability bias. Reporting feelings of anxiety or shame may itself be perceived as unmasculine, leading men to underreport these responses. This concern is particularly acute in this context, as masculine identity threat is inherently tied to concerns about appearing insufficiently masculine.

An alternative approach involves assessing threat responses through attitudinal outcomes. Masculinity threats have been shown to increase the justification of social inequality @weaver2015justification or tolerance for sexual violence @vescio2025masculinity. 
These measures offer a balance between practical feasibility and construct validity, as attitudes can be assessed through standard questionnaire formats while remaining less transparent than direct emotion reports. 
However, attitudinal measures may be particularly problematic in highly educated samples, where baseline endorsement of discriminatory attitudes tends to be low. Furthermore, attitudinal measures fail to distinguish between internalized and externalized responses. Because a single attitude can stem from either defensive aggression or compensatory anxiety, these measures capture the behavioral "output" of a threat rather than the specific cognitive process that triggered it.

=== Implicit Measures

Implicit measures, such as the WFCT used in this study, are initially chosen because they offer significant theoretical advantages. Internalized responses like shame or anxiety are often incongruent with masculine norms and may be consciously denied in self-reports. By measuring the automatic activation of cognitions, implicit tasks can theoretically detect these genuine threat effects without relying on introspective access or willingness to report.

To retain the advantages of implicit testing while avoiding the lexical noise of word fragments, researchers might instead employ associative tasks like the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Rather than relying on the spontaneous completion of fragments, the IAT measures the relative strength of associations between concepts (e.g., "Self" and "Weakness"). This format is generally more robust across languages and less influenced by individual vocabulary differences or word frequencies.

However, the validity of the IAT for capturing acute psychological shifts remains a subject of significant debate. While the IAT-Anxiety has demonstrated strong internal consistency and predictive validity for trait-level anxiety and behavioral outcomes @egloff2002predictive, subsequent research found that the measure failed to register significant changes following experimental state-anxiety inductions @schmukle2004does. This suggests that while associative measures are psychometrically more stable than word fragments, they may be more sensitive to stable personality dispositions than to the fleeting, state-level cognitions triggered by a masculinity threat.

=== Behavioral Measures
Behavioral measures provide perhaps the most direct assessment of threat-relevant outcomes. Research has demonstrated masculinity threat effects on aggressive driving behavior in simulators @braly2018masculine and on the voluntary administration of electrical shocks @fowler2017threatened. These measures bypass the primary limitations of self-reports, as participants often do not recognize that their behavior reflects a defensive response to a psychological threat.

The primary disadvantage of behavioral approaches is that they are often resource-intensive and difficult to implement in large-scale online studies. To address this, future research could utilize game-like paradigms to measure masculinity threat responses. Such paradigms yield multiple advantages: First, in-game behavior can be evaluated automatically, providing a highly reliable and objective measure of response that is less susceptible to the "lexical noise" found in word completion tasks. Second, the interactive nature of a game-like task can be constructed to capture both internalized and externalized responses—for instance, by measuring cautious vs. aggressive playstyles following a threat. Finally, as participants in the present study reported that the GKT and WFCT were experienced as challenging and motivating, gamified measures may mitigate the attention problems and high attrition rates often faced in online research settings.

=== Recommendations for Future Research

Based on the present findings, several recommendations emerge for future research. First, researchers should prioritize validated dependent measures with established psychometric properties, particularly when working in non-English contexts. If new implicit tasks are developed, they must undergo thorough pilot testing and lexical validation to ensure the signal is not lost to noise. Second, while manipulation checks are essential to confirm that threats are perceived as intended, researchers must recognize that successful induction does not guarantee detectable effects if the measurement tool is insensitive. Third, researchers should consider "triangulating" threat responses by combining subtle self-reports with more robust associative or behavioral measures to capture both internalized and externalized pathways. Finally, the target population must match the measure; academic samples may require more sophisticated, gamified, or indirect behavioral paradigms to bypass high levels of research suspicion and social desirability.

== Validation of the German MMB Scale 

While the study did not observe the hypothesized moderation effects, it successfully established a psychometrically sound German translation of the MMB scale. Unlike the WFCT, the MMB scale demonstrated adequate variability even within a highly educated sample, suggesting that the academic background of participants did not result in a conscious rejection of traditional masculinity norms which would have resulted in "floor effects." However, the validation process revealed three specific challenges that required careful refinement of the scale’s factorial and linguistic structure.

The first challenge concerned the relationship between the two latent factors. While the original model suggested they might be orthogonal, the German data required allowing pressured and autonomous motivation to correlate to achieve an acceptable fit. This shift from an orthogonal to a correlated model provides a theoretical solution that aligns with the foundational work of @good2010doing; a man's personal ideals (autonomous) do not develop in a vacuum but in constant dialogue with societal expectations (pressured). The internalization of these norms implies an inherent overlap rather than a total separation of motivational sources.

The second challenge involved the poor discriminant validity of Item 9 ("It is important to me not to be feminine"). This item demonstrated significant cross-loading, a pattern that mirrors the observations of @stanaland2021man in the original validation. The solution of excluding this item highlights that the "rejection of femininity" may be a more complex construct than a simple motivational driver. Because anti-femininity is a core, externally enforced tenet of traditional masculine socialization, it may be inherently difficult for participants to experience such attitudes as purely autonomous, reflecting the deep-seated nature of gender binaries.

The final challenge was the linguistic translation of the scale. The primary difficulty lay in finding a phrasing that accurately reflects the nuanced personal choice of endorsing masculinity ideals—both internally and externally—without sounding non-intuitive to German participants. To address this, the solution was to employ a strategic mix of trait-like formulations ("männlich sein") and agentic, behavioral expressions ("sich männlich verhalten"). This balanced approach preserved the meaning of the English items while ensuring the scale remained accessible to a German-speaking sample.

These refinements provide a clear roadmap for future research. By employing a correlated two-factor model and a refined item set, researchers can now reliably assess the motivational drivers of masculine behavior in German-speaking populations, pairing this validated instrument with more robust dependent measures in future investigations.

=== Theretical Considerations

While the psychometric limitations of the WFCT provide a compelling explanation for the null findings, a purely methodological critique may be incomplete. Recent empirical developments have imposed significant challenges to the EDT model and the precarious manhood thesis as a whole, suggesting that the absence of effects may reflect broader theoretical boundary conditions.

== Challenges to EDT Model 

The failure to detect the predicted moderation effects warrants a closer examination of the EDT model’s structural assumptions. Specifically, three key challenges emerge from the current literature and the present results.

First, there is a persistent lack of empirical evidence for the autonomous-anxious pathway. While the pressured-aggression link has seen some support, the prediction that autonomous motivation leads to increased anxious cognition has not been consistently replicated @stanaland2021man. This suggests that the motivational drivers of internalized threat responses may be more complex than a simple linear moderation.

Second, the model assumes a parallel structure for internalized and externalized responses, which contrasts with alternative frameworks suggesting a sequential relationship. Other scholars propose that men may initially experience internal distress—such as shame or anxiety—which then escalates into outward aggression as a form of compensation @vescio2025masculinity. In this view, externalized responses are not independent of anxiety but are a functional relief for the discomfort it causes @jakupcak2005masculinity. If aggression is a secondary reaction to an primary anxious state, the EDT model’s attempt to split these paths by motivation may overlook the dynamic nature of threat regulation.

Third, a significant "missing link" in the current framework is the role of control beliefs. In general psychological theory, the appraisal of an event as a "threat" versus a "challenge" depends heavily on a person's perceived agency to manage the situation @lazarus1984stress. Regardless of whether a man’s motivation is pressured or autonomous, his response may be determined by his perceived ability to "restore" his status. If a participant perceives high control over his gender performance, he may favor proactive behaviors over the anxious or aggressive cognitions captured by implicit tasks. In German samples, where gender roles may be negotiated with more flexibility due to higher societal equality, these control beliefs might play a more dominant role than motivational orientation alone.

== Challenges to Precarious Manhood

Beyond the specific parameters of the EDT model, the present findings contribute to a growing theoretical debate regarding the inherent vulnerability of gender identity. Traditionally, the precarious manhood thesis has posited a fundamental asymmetry: while womanhood is viewed as a biological "given," manhood is framed as a tenuous social status that must be earned through continuous validation and can be revoked upon failure @vandello2013hard.

However, recent evidence has begun to dismantle this binary assumption. #cite(<wittlin2024us>, form: "prose") demonstrated that threats to femininity—specifically regarding physical appearance evoke anxiety and self-esteem deficits in women that closely mirror the "precarious" responses previously attributed only to men. These findings suggest that gender precariousness may be more symmetric than originally theorized, rooted in the social construction of gendered expectations rather than the specific nature of masculinity @chrisler2013womanhood @addis2013theory.

If the "uniqueness" of masculinity's precariousness is receding, particularly in egalitarian cultures, the absence of traditional threat-response patterns may reflect a broader theoretical shift. Future research should move away from the assumption that masculinity is uniquely volatile and instead examine gender identity as a multi-dimensional construct where precariousness can be experienced across the gender spectrum.

== Conclusion

The present study aimed to replicate masculinity threat effects and test predictions of the EDT model in a German sample. None of the four hypotheses were supported: neither main effects of threat on aggressive or anxious cognition nor moderation by pressured or autonomous motivation reached statistical significance. These null findings are attributed to inadequate measurement rather than absence of the underlying phenomena, given the poor psychometric properties of the German WFCT.

Despite these limitations, the study makes two positive contributions. First, the manipulation checks demonstrate that the masculinity threat paradigm can successfully induce perceived threats in German samples, providing a foundation for future studies with better outcome measures. Second, the validated German translation of the MMB scale enables future research on masculine motivation in German-speaking populations.

Future research on masculinity threat effects should prioritize validated dependent measures with established psychometric properties. Word fragment completion tasks, while theoretically attractive for their implicit nature, may not transfer reliably across languages and should be thoroughly validated before use in substantive hypothesis testing. Alternative approaches—including self-report measures, behavioral paradigms, and physiological indicators—each carry their own limitations but may provide more reliable assessments of threat-induced cognition and affect. The continued development and validation of masculinity threat paradigms remains an important goal for understanding how gender identity shapes psychological responses to social evaluation.


// == Motivation for Masculine Behaviour in a German Sample

// Despite the null findings regarding masculinity threat effects, the present study makes a positive contribution by establishing a validated German translation of the MMB scale. This section discusses the factorial structure of the translated scale, considerations regarding the sample and translation process, and implications for future use.

// === Factorial Structure of the MMB Scale

// The CFA revealed that the hypothesized two-factor structure—distinguishing pressured motivation from autonomous motivation—provided an acceptable fit to the data, albeit with several modifications from the original model. 
// The most notable departure from the original #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") specification was the need to model the two factors as correlated rather than orthogonal. Constraining the factors to be uncorrelated produced poor model fit, whereas allowing them to correlate improved fit substantially.
// #todo[remove "the most notable" expressison, because the removal of an item is also very very notable].

// This correlation between pressured and autonomous motivation is theoretically plausible. A man's personal ideals regarding masculinity are not formed in isolation but develop in dialogue with societal expectations. The internalization process through which external norms become personal values implies that pressured and autonomous motivation should show some overlap. Supporting this interpretation, the original studies by #cite(<good2010doing>, form: "prose") that investigated the distinction between internal and external motivation to conform to gender stereotypes also reported moderate correlations between factors.

// A second modification involved excluding Item 9 ("It is important to me not to be feminine") from the autonomous motivation subscale. This item showed equal loadings (.39) on both factors, indicating poor discriminant validity. Notably, a similar pattern emerged in the original validation by #cite(<stanaland2023masculinity>, form: "prose"), where Item 9 loaded only marginally higher on autonomous (.43) than pressured (.36) motivation. The consistent cross-loading suggests that rejection of femininity may inherently involve externally referenced standards rather than purely intrinsic motivation. Anti-femininity norms are among the earliest and most consistently enforced aspects of masculine socialization, which may make it difficult for men to experience such attitudes as autonomous rather than imposed.

// === Translation Considerations

// An initial concern was that the predominantly academic sample might show restricted variance on the MMB scale, with highly educated participants uniformly rejecting traditional masculinity norms. However, the data did not support this concern. Both subscales showed adequate variability, with no evidence of floor effects that would compromise measurement validity.

// A more significant challenge involved the translation process itself. German offers multiple ways to express the concept of "being masculine," ranging from trait-like formulations ("männlich sein") to more agentic expressions ("sich männlich verhalten"). The former implies a stable characteristic, whereas the latter suggests behavioral enactment. This distinction maps onto broader debates in gender research about whether masculinity is best understood as a fixed trait or a performative accomplishment. The present translation opted for a mix of formulations, attempting to preserve the meaning of each English item as closely as possible. Post-hoc analyses revealed no evidence of a method factor distinguishing state-like from agentic items, suggesting that participants did not systematically differentiate between these framings.

// === Implications for Future Use

// The successful validation of the German MMB scale enables future research on motivation for masculine behavior in German-speaking populations. Researchers wishing to use the scale should note several recommendations. First, the two-factor structure should be modeled with correlated rather than uncorrelated factors. Second, Item 9 may be omitted given its consistent cross-loading pattern, or researchers may choose to retain it and examine whether the cross-loading replicates in their data. Third, the distinction between trait-like and agentic phrasings of masculinity items warrants continued attention, although the present study found no evidence that this distinction affected factor structure.
