// Implicit introduction heading level 1
At the core of our being lies our identity: a dynamic, multifaceted self-concept shaped by our personal journeys and the social groups we inhabit. Whether grounded in gender, class, or shared passions, these affiliations influence how we see ourselves, how others perceive us, and the expectations placed upon us. They provide a sense of belonging and purpose, and their norms often serve as guardrails that offer stability amid life's unpredictability. Yet, when these guardrails become too narrow, they risk becoming barriers. Meant to protect, they can instead constrain. Few sets of social norms illustrate this tension as vividly as those surrounding masculinity.

== Masculinity Norms and Their Psychological Cost
Masculinity norms shape men's lives across their entire lifespan. From an early age, boys internalize anti-femininity norms, such as the belief that #quote(attribution: [@blakemore2003children])[boys shouldn't look like girls]. This early form of gender policing continues into adolescence, where young men report feeling pressured to engage in heterosexual activity @duckworth2019gender. Additional masculinity norms include emotional restriction, self-reliance, the pursuit of achievement and status, aggression, and rejection of homosexuality @levant1992male. While the content of masculinity norms varies with their cultural background, they all shape male behavior and experience @lease2013cross.

Conforming to strict masculinity norms carries significant psychological and social costs. Attempting to meet these expectations, and potentially failing to do so, is associated with elevated stress @pleck1995gender and linked to a range of negative mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety @blazina1996masculine. Moreover, status-seeking and dominance-related pressures contribute to aggressive behaviors like sexual violence @rando1998gender. 

The psychological strain that occurs when a man's personal needs, values, or emotions conflict with the narrow range of behaviors deemed socially acceptable for men is referred to as men’s gender role conflict @o1986gender. Although the negative consequences of this conflict are well documented @o2008summarizing, the processes through which this strain develops remain poorly understood. To understand why the costs of masculinity norms are so persistent, it is crucial to consider how masculinity is not just a set of traits, but a social status that must be earned and maintained.

== Masculinity as a Precarious Social Status
"Men are made, not born": the idea that masculinity functions as a socially granted status rather than a fixed set of traits has been documented across diverse cultures @gilmore1990manhood.
In contrast to womanhood, which is often perceived as a natural, biological outcome, manhood is viewed as a status that must be earned, actively maintained, and socially validated @vandello2013hard.
This notion has been coined the precarious manhood thesis and demonstrated in various experiments: 
By inducing a masculinity threat (e.g., giving men credible negative feedback about their masculinity or letting them perform stereotypically feminine tasks), researchers have observed men (but not women) responding to such perceived threats to their masculinity with shame and anxiety @vandello2008precarious or aggression and dominance @bosson2009precarious.
These defensive reactions to identity threats have led to the popular characterization of masculinity as _fragile_ @stanaland2023masculinity: the notion that a man's social status as a "real man" is so tenuous that it must be constantly defended and protected.

The fragile nature of masculinity serves as a link between the psychological strain experienced by the individual and the negative consequences of narrow masculinity norms for broader society.
In a series of studies, researchers have found masculinity threats to provoke physical aggression @bosson2009precarious, ideological dominance and prejudice toward women @dahl2015threats, denial of social inequities @weaver2015justification, anti-gay prejudice @brown2023experimentally, violence toward gay men @parrott2008determinants, and the tolerance of such violence through inaction @schermerhorn2022perceptions. The negative consequences of this justify a need for better understanding of the psychological mechanisms behind this behaviour.

One observation in masculinity threat research has been of particular interest. Empirical studies have revealed that both anxiousness @vandello2008precarious and aggression @bosson2009precarious are men's responses to masculinity threats. These responses also mirror the psychological strain experienced in men's gender role conflict, which includes depression and anxiety @blazina1996masculine as well as aggressive behaviors such as sexual violence @rando1998gender. 
To address why men respond to masculinity threats in different ways, researchers have suggested studying the underlying motivations for conforming to masculine norms.

== A Motivational Framework for Masculinity Threats

Although stereotypically masculine behaviors may appear uniform on the surface, the motivations behind them can differ significantly. Men may engage in gender-conforming behavior for autonomous reasons, because they freely choose and genuinely value such behavior, or for pressured reasons, because they feel compelled by external expectations or fear of rejection @good2010doing. This distinction between _autonomous_ and _pressured_ motivation for gender-conforming behaviour was applied to research on masculinity responses.
In a pioneering study, #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") developed a Motivation for Masculine Behaviour (MMB) scale that successfully distinguished autonomous and pressured motivation to be masculine. To induce a masculinity threat, participants received feedback indicating they had performed worse than other men on a Gender Knowledge Test (GKT). The results showed that men who received this threat exhibited increased aggressive cognition, compared to men who received neutral feedback. Moreover, men's pressured motivation to be masculine, measured by the MMB, predicted aggressive cognition for men exposed to a masculinity threat: Men with higher pressured motivation showed more aggressive cognition following a masculinity threat.

Building on this evidence, #cite(<stanaland2023masculinity>, form: "prose") introduced the expectancy-discrepancy-threat (EDT) model of masculine identity (@fig:EDT-Model) to explain the differences in masculinity threat responses.
According to this model, boys and men are socialized into rigid masculinity norms and expectations.
Drawing from self-discrepancy theory @higgins1987self, the EDT model proposes that men develop three domains of the self: the actual self (who they believe they are), the ideal self (who they aspire to be), and the ought self (who they feel they should be, based on societal expectations).

When men's actual selves do not align with their ideal or ought selves, as in the context of a masculinity threat, they may experience two types of identity discrepancies.
The first is an actual-ought discrepancy: a gap between who they are and who they believe they should be. The second is an actual-ideal discrepancy: a gap between who they are and who they aspire to be.

Drawing from self-determination theory @deci1987support, the EDT model proposes that these discrepancies produce distinct motivational responses.
An actual-ought discrepancy generates pressured (extrinsic) motivation to reduce the tension, which is associated with externalized responses such as aggression.
An actual-ideal discrepancy produces autonomous (intrinsic) motivation, which tends to result in internalized reactions such as shame or anxiety.
Importantly, men are unlikely to experience only one type of discrepancy.
Rather, they often experience both forms to different extents, depending on their underlying motivations to conform to masculinity norms. The increased aggressive threat response observed by @stanaland2021man can be understood through this model: men with higher pressured motivation likely experienced a greater actual-ought discrepancy, leading them to show an externalized, i.e., aggressive response.

  note:[Adapted from Stanaland et al. (2023). Men are socialized to conform to societal norms of masculinity. Different types of self-discrepancies, between the actual self (how one perceives oneself), the ideal self (who one wishes to be), and the ought self (who one believes they should be), can give rise to distinct motivational processes. When masculinity is threatened, an actual-ought discrepancy is thought to trigger extrinsic motivation, often resulting in externalized compensatory behaviors (e.g., aggression). In contrast, an actual-ideal discrepancy is believed to foster intrinsic motivation, leading to an internalized compensatory response (e.g., anxiousness).]

== The Present Research
By investigating men's motivation for masculine behaviour, as well as masculinity threat responses, the present research makes two key contributions. First, it extends existing research on fragile masculinity by assessing its cross-cultural generalizability in a German sample. Second, it addresses limited empirical evidence for the pathways proposed by the EDT model.

=== Cross-Cultural Generalizability of Masculinity Threat Effects

Much of the foundational research on fragile masculinity and the precariousness of manhood has been conducted in the United States @stanaland2021man@bosson2009precarious@vandello2008precarious. This raises concerns about the generalizability of these findings to other cultural contexts with differing gender norms and expectations. For example, the United States, particularly rural, Southern regions, is often described as an individualistic and "honor"-based culture that simultaneously emphasizes and challenges men's masculinity @cohen1996insult. In such contexts, aggressive behavior may serve as a norm-consistent response among men whose masculinity is closely tied to external validation @stanaland2022fragile.

Widespread beliefs about the precariousness of manhood, documented in Germany and other European nations, suggest that masculinity threat effects are not limited to the United States @bosson2021psychometric. This is further supported by studies in Poland and Norway, in which men responded to masculinity threats with increased aggressive cognition @valved2021gender and reduced support for gender equality @kosakowska2016if. Notably, cross-cultural differences in threat responses appear to correspond with broader societal patterns: countries with higher gender inequality and lower human development scores tend to show stronger beliefs in the precariousness of manhood @bosson2021psychometric. This is consistent with the stronger threat response observed in Polish men compared to Norwegian men @valved2021gender.

Taken together, the prevalence of precarious manhood beliefs and empirical support from European populations make it plausible to expect compensatory responses to a masculinity threat in the present study. Although the present research is conducted in Germany, a country with relatively high gender equality #citeWithPrefix(prefix: "Rank 7/146;", keys: <wef2024gendergap>), threat effects are still expected to emerge, albeit potentially with smaller effect sizes. This expectation is supported by prior findings showing that in Norway, a country with even higher levels of gender equality #citeWithPrefix(prefix: "Rank 3/146;", keys: <wef2024gendergap>), men still exhibited increased aggressive cognition following a masculinity threat @valved2021gender. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed:

- *Hypothesis 1a*: Men exposed to a masculinity threat will exhibit higher levels of aggressive cognition than men who do not receive a masculinity threat.
- *Hypothesis 1b*: Men exposed to a masculinity threat will exhibit higher levels of anxious cognition than men who do not receive a masculinity threat.

=== Testing Motivational Predictors of Threat Response

Although the EDT model is theoretically compelling, empirical support for its proposed pathways remains limited. Two studies have found that pressured motivation to be masculine moderates aggressive threat responses, with men higher in pressured motivation showing increased aggressive cognition following a masculinity threat @stanaland2021man @stanaland2024adolescent. However, the second pathway—proposing that autonomous motivation moderates internalized threat responses such as anxiety—remains untested.

Moreover, the model faces conceptual challenges from alternative frameworks that propose a sequential relationship between internalized and externalized threat responses. These frameworks suggest that men may initially experience internal distress (e.g., shame or anxiety), which then escalates into outward aggression @vescio2025masculinity. In this view, externalized responses serve as compensation for internal distress. This pattern is rooted in research showing that the expression of anger relieves feelings of discomfort @jakupcak2005masculinity. These competing perspectives highlight the need for careful empirical testing of the EDT model's predictions.

To explain inter-individual differences in men's responses to masculinity threats, the present research tests the EDT model's predictions. According to the model, pressured motivation is associated with externalized responses: men primarily motivated by external expectations experience an actual-ought discrepancy when threatened, which activates extrinsic motivation and manifests as aggression. Conversely, autonomous motivation is linked to internalized responses: men who genuinely value masculine ideals experience an actual-ideal discrepancy when threatened, resulting in anxiety or shame. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed:

- *Hypothesis 2a*: Pressured motivation to conform to masculinity norms increases the positive effect of a masculinity threat (compared to the no-threat condition) on aggressive cognition.
- *Hypothesis 2b*: Autonomous motivation to conform to masculinity norms increases the positive effect of a masculinity threat (compared to the no-threat condition) on anxious cognition.

=== Addressing Methodological Limitations

Methodological challenges persist in studying masculinity threat and the EDT model. While prior research has often operationalized masculinity threat responses through self-report measures, the present study focuses on cognitive activation, specifically aggressive and anxious cognition.

This approach offers two key advantages. First, internalized emotional responses such as shame or anxiety are often incongruent with dominant masculinity norms and may be consciously downplayed or denied in self-report or behavioral tasks. Second, aggressive actions may sometimes reflect socially learned scripts rather than genuine emotional reactivity.

To address these limitations, the present study employs the Word Fragment Completion Task (WFCT), an implicit measure in which participants complete word fragments that can be resolved as either target words (e.g., aggressive or anxious) or neutral alternatives. This task has been successfully used to assess aggressive cognition @stanaland2021man @stanaland2024adolescent and anxious cognition @vandello2008precarious in masculinity threat research. Because implicit cognitive tasks are less susceptible to social desirability bias, they provide a more direct measure of underlying threat-relevant mental processes. Thus, assessing cognitive activation allows for a more sensitive examination of how masculinity threats are internally processed.
