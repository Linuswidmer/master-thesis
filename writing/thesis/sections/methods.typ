== Ethical Considerations and Pre-Registration
Prior to data collection, ethical considerations were addressed regarding the use of a deceptive experimental manipulation and its potential to elicit negative emotional reactions.
To mitigate any persisting effects of this deception, the debriefing procedure adhered to established ethical guidelines for research involving deception, including dehoaxing, desensitization, justification of the deception, and an option to withdraw data #citeWithPrefix(prefix: "see", keys: <sommers2013forgoing>).
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology at Humboldt University of Berlin.

For transparency, the study's aims, hypotheses, methods, and data analytic plan were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/n6py4).
Any deviations from the pre-registration are justified and reported in the relevant sections. 

== Participants
An a priori power analysis indicated a required sample size of 229 participants (see Appendix ...).
Eligibility criteria included self-identification as male, native-level proficiency in German, and a minimum age of 18 years.
A total of 196 participants were recruited over a two-month period by distributing flyers in social spaces and through an online study exchange platform.
In exchange for participation, 1€ was donated to a men's counseling organization.

Participants were excluded based on pre-registered criteria.
First, 8 participants withdrew consent after debriefing.
Of the remaining sample, 13 participants did not meet eligibility requirements (9 reported a gender other than male, 3 were under 18 years of age, and 1 reported insufficient German proficiency).
Furthermore, 9 participants were excluded for expressing strong suspicion about the study's true purpose (open-text responses were independently coded, and participants who correctly identified the masculinity threat manipulation were excluded), 11 for completing fewer than 50% real words on the WFCT, and 1 for missing all items on the MMB scale.
After applying these criteria, 42 participants were excluded in total, resulting in a final sample of $N = 154$ (no-threat condition: $n = 78$; threat condition: $n = 76$).

Participants ranged in age from 18 to 69 years (#reportMeanAndSD(mean: 30.6, sd: 10.9)).
The sample was predominantly highly educated: 80.5% held at least a general university entrance qualification (Abitur), and 60.4% had completed a university degree.

== Procedure
The procedure was adapted from #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose") and translated into German.
After providing informed consent, participants were informed that the study concerned personality, motivation, and performance in men.
They were also reminded that eligibility required identifying as male, native-level proficiency in German, and a minimum age of 18 years.

In the first section, participants completed the Motivation for Masculine Behavior scale.
Next, they were informed they would complete a Gender Knowledge Test, supposedly measuring knowledge in areas typically associated with men or women in society.
Upon completion, participants received either (a) threatening feedback indicating worse performance than the average man, or (b) non-threatening feedback indicating performance comparable to the average man.
This feedback was not based on participants' actual responses but was randomly assigned by experimental condition.

Following the feedback, participants completed the WFCT to assess aggressive and anxious cognition.
For each item, they were instructed to complete a partial word by typing the missing first letter.
Items were presented in randomized order, with a seven-second time limit per item to encourage spontaneous, intuitive responses.

Participants then completed a demographic questionnaire.
Afterward, they were asked whether they had any suspicions about the study's true purpose and, if so, were invited to describe them.
As a manipulation check, all participants recalled the type of feedback they had received on the Gender Knowledge Test and provided a self-evaluation of their own gender knowledge.

Upon completing all study components, participants received a full debriefing.
This included an explanation of the study's true purpose and a clarification that the feedback provided during the Gender Knowledge Test was fabricated and randomly assigned.
The rationale for the deception was explained, and participants were offered the option to withdraw their data.

== Materials
The experimental procedure was adapted from #cite(<stanaland2021man>, form: "prose"). The Motivation for Masculine Behavior scale was taken from #cite(<stanaland2023masculinity>, form: "prose") Study 2, which uses a version of the scale that does not require a prior description of masculinity ideals. The Gender Knowledge Test was adapted from #cite(<valved2021gender>, form: "prose"). All materials were translated from English to German following the Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation (TRAPD) protocol @harkness2010translation. Complete materials including all item wordings in both languages and documentation of the translation process are provided in the Appendix.

=== Motivation for Masculine Behavior
Nine items from the Motivation for Masculine Behavior scale were used to measure participants' motivation for enacting masculine behavior.
Responses were recorded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (_strongly disagree_) to 7 (_strongly agree_).
The scale comprises two subscales: Pressured Motivation (5 items; e.g., "In general, I'm masculine because I want others' acceptance and approval") and Autonomous Motivation (4 items; e.g., "I enjoy being masculine").
See #ref(<table:mmb-items>) for all items with German translations.

=== Gender Knowledge Test
The Gender Knowledge Test, originally developed by #cite(<rudman2004reactions>, form: "prose"), was used in a version culturally adapted for European participants by #cite(<valved2021gender>, form: "prose").
Thirty items covering stereotypically masculine (e.g., sports, combat, home repair) and feminine (e.g., cooking, childcare, fashion) knowledge domains were included.
Items were designed with moderate to high difficulty to support the credibility of the subsequent bogus feedback.
Each item presented one correct and one incorrect response option (e.g., "The paste used for soldering joints is called: gel vs. flux"; "The first company to develop hair coloring was: Clairol vs. L'Oréal").
See #ref(<table:gkt-items>) for all items with German translations.

=== Masculinity Threatening and Non-Threatening Feedback
To administer the masculinity threat, participants were shown a diagram depicting a fictitious distribution of scores on the Gender Knowledge Test.
In the threat condition, participants were told they scored –1.83, substantially below the purported male average of +2.24, with an accompanying statement that their answers were "more similar to women than to men."
In the no-threat condition, participants were told they scored +2.18, close to the male average, indicating "typical" performance for male participants.
Both conditions included a visual distribution graph highlighting the participant's position relative to other men.
Screenshots of both feedback conditions are provided in the Appendix.

=== Word Fragment Completion Task
The Word Fragment Completion Task (WFCT) was used to assess aggressive and anxious cognition.
Word fragments were developed by first identifying German words semantically related to aggression ("Wut" [anger], "Ärger" [frustration]) and anxiety ("Angst" [fear], "Furcht" [fear]) using the Word Associations Network (https://wordassociations.net/de/). For each target word, potential word fragments were generated by removing the first letter. Fragments were retained only if they could be completed as both a target word and at least one neutral alternative. This ensured that each fragment was ambiguous and that responses could reflect underlying cognitive accessibility rather than forced choice.
Twenty word fragments (ten aggressive, ten anxious) were presented in randomized order.
Each fragment could be completed as either a target word (aggressive or anxious) or a neutral word.
For example, "\_UT" could become "WUT" (anger; aggressive) or "HUT" (hat; neutral); "\_ANGEN" could become "BANGEN" (to fear; anxious) or "WANGEN" (cheeks; neutral).
See #ref(<table:wfct-aggressive>) and #ref(<table:wfct-anxious>) for all word fragments and their possible completions.

=== Manipulation Check and Suspicion Probe
To verify that participants correctly perceived the experimental manipulation, two manipulation check items were administered.
Participants recalled the type of feedback they received on the Gender Knowledge Test and provided a self-evaluation of their own gender knowledge, both on a scale from 1 (_typically feminine_) to 10 (_typically masculine_).
To assess suspicion, participants indicated whether they believed the study concerned something other than what was stated.
If they responded affirmatively, they were prompted to describe their suspicions.
Additionally, participants were given the opportunity to share any other thoughts about the study in an open-text field.
See #ref(<table:manipulation-check>) for all items with German translations.

=== Demographic Questionnaire
Participants reported their age, gender, German language proficiency, highest educational degree, and highest occupational degree.
See #ref(<table:demographics>) for all items with German translations. 

== Design
The study employed a between-subjects experimental design with random assignment to one of two conditions: masculinity threat (threatening feedback) or no threat (non-threatening feedback). Two dependent variables were assessed: aggressive cognition and anxious cognition, each operationalized as the proportion of target word completions on the respective WFCT subscales. Motivation for masculine behavior was measured prior to the experimental manipulation and examined as a moderator. Specifically, pressured motivation was hypothesized to moderate the effect of threat on aggressive cognition, whereas autonomous motivation was hypothesized to moderate the effect of threat on anxious cognition.
